  caveats <<~EOS
    If the Mac App Store edition of Incise is already in /Applications, this
    install fails with "there is already an App at /Applications/Incise.app".
    Either delete the App Store copy first, or let Homebrew replace it:

      brew install --cask --force incise

    The App Store build is sandboxed, so its preferences and last session do
    not carry over. Your files are untouched.
